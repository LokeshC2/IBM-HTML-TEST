JAVA

Programming language, development environment, and  application environment, and deployment environment all in one.
Its used to develop applets applications for desktop, web, mobile, and embedded devices.

Easy to use, avoids common programming errors, and is object oriented. Allows creating streamlined and clear code.

JAVA is compiled into bytecode which is interpreted by the JVM. This allows the same code to run on any platform.

Java can also be Just In Time (JIT) compiled to native code for faster execution.

JVM DOES THREE THINGS:
  Loads code
  Verifies code
  Executes code

JVM is platform dependent, but Java is platform independent.
